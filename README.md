# Predict Fare of Airlines Tickets using Machine Learning
```
## Overview
```
This project aims to predict the fare of airline tickets using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features such as the date of the journey, departure time, arrival time, duration, airline, source, destination, number of stops, and price. By analyzing these features and building a machine learning model, we can predict the fare of airline tickets accurately.

```
## Project Structure
```
- `Data_Train.xlsx`: Excel file containing the training dataset.
- `Predict_Airline_Fare.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.
- `rf_random.pkl`: Pickle file containing the trained RandomForestRegressor model.
- `flight_departure_time_categories.png`: Image file showing the distribution of flight departure time categories.
- `flight_price_vs_duration.png`: Image file showing the relationship between flight price and duration.
- `flight_price_vs_duration_categories.png`: Image file showing flight price vs. total duration with different numbers of stops.

## Dependencies
```
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using pip:

- pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
## Usage
```
1. Clone the repository:

- git clone https://github.com/your-username/airline-fare-prediction.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

- cd airline-fare-prediction

3. Open and run the `Predict_Airline_Fare.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Google Colab).

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis, build a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.

```
## Results
```
The machine learning model achieved a high R-squared score and low Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), indicating good performance in predicting the fare of airline tickets.
```
## Future Work
```
- Deploy the trained model as a web application to allow users to predict the fare of airline tickets.
- Explore additional features or data sources to improve the model's predictive performance.
- Perform further analysis to understand the factors influencing the fare of airline tickets.
